        <h2>Mount Everest</h2>
        <p><strong>Mount Everest</strong>, located in the Himalayas, is the highest mountain on Earth, standing at an astounding 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. It straddles the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Known as <em>Sagarmatha</em> in Nepal and <em>Chomolungma</em> in Tibet, Everest has attracted mountaineers from around the world for decades.</p>

        <p>Climbing Everest is an extremely challenging and dangerous task. Despite its beauty, the mountain is notorious for its harsh conditions, including extreme cold, strong winds, and low oxygen levels. Each year, hundreds of climbers attempt to reach the summit, but the success rate is low, and many lives have been lost. However, the lure of standing at the top of the world continues to draw adventurers and mountaineers to its slopes.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>World's highest mountain at 8,848.86 meters</li>

          <li>Attracts hundreds of climbers annually despite its dangers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges of Climbing Everest</h3>
        <p>The journey to the summit of Mount Everest is not for the faint of heart. The expedition involves:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Severe altitude sickness due to low oxygen levels</li>
          <li>Extreme weather conditions, including freezing temperatures and high winds</li>
          <li>Physical and mental endurance required to climb for days in difficult terrain</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The mountain has a rich history of expeditions, with Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay famously reaching the summit in 1953. Since then, countless mountaineers have followed in their footsteps, despite the dangers and high risk of fatalities.</p>
